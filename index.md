### Summary

I chose the software development industry because it constantly provides new challenges.
I&#39;m happiest when I&#39;m solving problems.
I have a passion for writing tools that either make tasks easier to complete or eliminate them altogether.

### Work Experience

#### Microsoft - Software Development Engineer

*June 2012 - Present*

##### Visual Studio Client Tools

I am building cross-platform tools and cloud services that make it easier for hybrid mobile developers (Cordova, PhoneGap, React Native) to build apps. With my experience utilizing Azure and Node, I've been able to help my team ramp up quickly as we utilize this technology to build scalable REST APIs and cross-platform CLI tools. I also took charge of setting up and maintaining our CI tooling so that we can ensure quality while iterating quickly.

Previously on this team, I rewrote and shipped a new DOM Explorer tool for IE/Edge with Windows 10 and Visual Studio 2015. The updated tool has improved performance on large websites, and fixes a number of UI bugs.


##### ACM Authoring and Asset Management

I built tools for authoring a wide variety of ad experiences. In addition to maintaining legacy ad creation tools, I built the next generation of tooling using modern technology: Angular, ASP.NET, and Node, hosted on Windows Azure.

In addition to client-side tools, I built and maintained the backend service for storage, management, encoding, and delivery of creative assets such as images and videos. This service was built on cloud technology (Windows Azure), and designed to be highly available and scalable.

##### Bing Autopilot

I worked on the private cloud infrastructure for the Online Services Division (Bing, MSN). My team wrote and maintained the software that deploys and monitors services and data for Bing, Bing Ads, and MSN.
