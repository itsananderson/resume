### Summary

I chose the software development industry because it constantly provides new challenges.
I'm happiest when I'm solving problems.
I have a passion for writing tools that either make tasks easier to complete or eliminate them altogether.

### Work Experience

#### Microsoft - Software Development Engineer

*June 2012 - Present*

##### ACM Authoring and Asset Management (2013 - Present)

I'm building tools for authoring a wide variety of ad experiences. In addition to maintaining legacy ad creation tools, I'm building the next generation of tooling using modern technology: Angular, ASP.NET, and Node, hosted on Windows Azure.

In addition to client-side tools, I built, and am maintaining the backend service for storage, management, encoding, and delivery of creative assets such as images and videos. This service was built on cloud technology (Windows Azure), and is designed to be highly available and scalable.

##### Bing Autopilot (2012 - 2013)

I worked on the private cloud infrastructure for the Online Services Division (Bing, MSN). My team wrote and maintained the software that deploys and monitors services and data for Bing, Bing Ads, and MSN.
